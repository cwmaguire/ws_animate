ws_animator
=====
An Erlang web server for animating in JS over a web socket.

Overview
-----
Web sockets connect to the Cowboy web server; Cowboy starts up our process to handle messages from the socket; our socket can connect to a "channel", which communicates with animator processes. Each socket can have one channel, but multiple sockets can have the same channel; each animator has one channel, but a channel can have multiple animators.
